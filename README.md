# MaMD
Minimalist tool for turning an arbitrary structure of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) files into pleasantly formatted HTML using [Goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark), with syntax highlighting support from [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma)

Used as a super lightweight offline documentation generator.

The style applied uses [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) for text and [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for code.
